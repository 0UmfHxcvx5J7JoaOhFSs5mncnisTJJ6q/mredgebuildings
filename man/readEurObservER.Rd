\note{
I download the report and snip a png of the table. Then I extract the
data with \href{https://extracttable.com/}{this online tool} and save it as a
tabular csv in the source folder. The Tool is not fully reliable. This
function throws an error if values don't sum up. You then have to correct the
csv file manually.
